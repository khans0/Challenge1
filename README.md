Description:

When given this code it was not accessible to users, to solve this issue the current HTML needed to be replaced with a sematic HTML. This was one of the first steps in making it more accessible. Other steps taken were adding alternatives 'alt' to all images. When changing the HTML the css had to be upgraded to ensure it matched up and showed the correct layout. 

As this webpage is now more accesible it also allows an improved SEO ability. This coding project taught me that using the corrct semantic HTML makes it much easier to users to understand the webpage aswell as improving its SEO.
